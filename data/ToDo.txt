Need to do:
------------
- fix startscreen performance.
- class headers. 
- make breakable cover.
- player losses all lifes when enemies reach the bottom plane of the screen.
- the increase of enemy speed needs to decrease in the end (so the last couple of enemies doesn't get ridiculous speed)
- add comments to all code.

Nice to do:
------------
- Sounds are not compressed. Compress sounds.
- MP competition. survival mode.
- different looking enemy shoots. 
- make a power up that increase how mny points the player get when killing enemies. 
- freeze time power up.
- make it possible to shoot the enemies shot (shots collide with shots).
- "shoot on shot" collision animation.
- the "machine gun" power'up could use a small "buff".
- Points should be based on the amount of life taken from the enemy.



In progress
---------------
- make a boss.


Done
---------------
- Enemy block stuck on left sketch edge when spawning. (sometimes they also get stuck in mid-air) / (is caused by the "+ millis()-lastMove" in the enemy handler class - fixed by removing the "lastmove" correction in the timefix.
- make a variable that moves the enemies fster depending on how many enemies left.
- Sync enemy animation.
- Enemies shjouldnt shoot when in pause-mode.
- when quitting a game and starting a new one then clear shots array. (was actually the dead enemies projectiles)
- correct UI textsize and font. 
- Text on powerups. Or make it more visible what PO you get. (floating points class).
- decrease how often enemies shoot.
- add AOE to homing misile power-up.
- make it more random when enemies turn into projectiles when they die. 
- fix so the floating text position doesn't follow the powerup if they spawn simultaneously.
- make breakable ground.

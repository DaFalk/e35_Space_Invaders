Need to do:
------------




Nice to do:
------------
- boss spawn sound
- boss die sound
- loading highscore loading screen does not display when player looses last life.  
- Sounds are not compressed. Compress sounds.
- different looking enemy shoots. 
- double points power up
- freeze time power up.
- Points should be based on the amount of life taken from the enemy.
- change enemy shot collision to color collision (for precision).



In progress
---------------



Done
---------------
- "shoot on shot" collision animation.
- add comments to all code.
- autotargeting weapons should not target boss

- make it so that the boss doesnt affect the respawn when the last enemy dies

- the speed from lvl 4 and onwards should be constrained
- the increase of enemy speed needs to decrease in the end (so the last couple of enemies doesn't get ridiculous speed)
- make breakable cover.
- fix startscreen performance.
- class headers. 
- "piercer" shot is broken
- the enemies still move dwon continuosly on the Y axis sometimes. 
- the boss spawns as a "regular" enemy (has to do with the timer)
- the "machine gun" power'up could use a small "buff".
- make a boss.
- Enemy block stuck on left sketch edge when spawning. (sometimes they also get stuck in mid-air) / (is caused by the "+ millis()-lastMove" in the enemy handler class - fixed by removing the "lastmove" correction in the timefix.
- make a variable that moves the enemies fster depending on how many enemies left.
- Sync enemy animation.
- Enemies shjouldnt shoot when in pause-mode.
- when quitting a game and starting a new one then clear shots array. (was actually the dead enemies projectiles)
- correct UI textsize and font. 
- Text on powerups. Or make it more visible what PO you get. (floating points class).
- decrease how often enemies shoot.
- add AOE to homing misile power-up.
- make it more random when enemies turn into projectiles when they die. 
- fix so the floating text position doesn't follow the powerup if they spawn simultaneously.
- make breakable ground.
